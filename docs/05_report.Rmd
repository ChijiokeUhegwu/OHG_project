# 1.0 Introduction

The global escalation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents one
of the most complex public health challenges of the 21st century,
necessitating a One Health approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health [1]. This study presents a comparative genomic analysis of AMR in *E. coli* isolates collected across nine countries, aiming to map the distribution and temporal dynamics of resistance determinants within diverse ecological niches. By investigating the genetic signatures of 100 bacterial isolates, this research seeks to identify high-risk resistance genes, such as extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase (ESBLs) and carbapenemases, and evaluate their prevalence across clinical and agricultural sectors. Understanding these cross-sectoral and geographic
patterns is critical for developing targeted surveillance and stewardship strategies to curb the international spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens.

# 2.0 Methodology

This study employed a bioinformatics pipeline integrating
high-throughput genomic data. A total of 100 bacterial isolates
collected between 2018 and 2022 were retrieved from the NCBI Pathogen
Detection Portal, spanning nine countries (Argentina, Brazil, New
Zealand, China, Nigeria, France, Germany, United Kingdom, and United
States). Initial processing and genomic characterization were conducted
in a Linux environment. To identify the presence of antimicrobial
resistance determinants, ResFinder was utilized to screen the assembled
sequences against a comprehensive database of known AMR genes
(Abricate). Following the initial detection phase, the raw output data
was imported into the R programming environment. Within R, the data
underwent rigorous cleaning and wrangling using the tidyverse suite to
standardize gene nomenclature and isolate metadata. Final analysis and
visualization were performed to identify temporal trends, geographic
clustering, and sector-specific resistance burdens, utilizing
hierarchical clustering and longitudinal mapping to illustrate the One
Health landscape of AMR.

# 3.0 Results and Discussion

## 3.1 Distribution of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Genes Across One Health Sources

The bar chart in Figure 1 illustrates a significant disparity in the
distribution of AMR-positive isolates across different sectors, with
human sources contributing the highest number of isolates, followed by
chicken and beef. From a One Health perspective, the substantial
presence of AMR-positive isolates in poultry (chicken) and livestock
(beef) highlights the risks associated with agricultural antibiotic use,
often employed for growth promotion or disease prevention. These animal
reservoirs serve as critical points of origin for resistant bacteria
that can enter the human food chain through contaminated meat products
or direct contact, facilitating the cross-species transmission of
multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens [1].

This overlapping distribution highlights the necessity for integrated
genomic surveillance that tracks resistance genes across all three
sectors: humans, animals, and the environment. Considering that bacteria
and their resistance-conferring genes (such as those on plasmids) move
easily between these domains via wastewater, agricultural runoff, and
food consumption, a high burden in one sector inevitably impacts the
others [2]. Consequently, these findings suggest that mitigating the global
AMR threat requires a unified strategy that addresses antibiotic
stewardship in human clinics while simultaneously improving biosecurity
and manure management in the livestock industry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3.2 AMR gene burden per isolate by source

Figure 2 highlights the disparity in AMR gene burden across
different isolation sources, with human isolates exhibiting the highest
and most variable number of resistance genes. The isolates from humans show a
median of approximately 8 genes per isolate, with several outliers
carrying nearly 20 distinct AMR genes. This high concentration likely
reflects the intense selective pressure found in clinical environments,
where the frequent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics drives the
accumulation of multiple resistance determinants within single bacterial
lineages.

In contrast, isolates from chicken and poultry sources show a moderate
gene burden, with medians hovering around 3 to 4 genes per isolate.
While lower than the human burden, the presence of numerous individual
isolates carrying upwards of 10 genes indicates that poultry remains a
significant reservoir for MDR bacteria. The wide distribution of data
points within the chicken category suggests a diverse range of
resistance profiles, possibly linked to varying farming practices and
antibiotic stewardship levels across the nine countries included in your
study.

The beef and clinical categories show the lowest gene burden, with most
isolates carrying only 1 or 2 AMR genes. This minimal burden suggests
that, in this specific dataset, these sources have not been subjected to
the same level of intensive antimicrobial pressure as human and poultry
sectors.

## 3.3 Top AMR genes detected across isolates

Figure 3 illustrates the high frequency and diversity of the most
occuring AMR genes detected across the 100 isolates. The figure is
dominated by genes conferring resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics,
which include penicillins and cephalosporins.

-   **blaCTX-M-15_1** is the most frequently detected gene, appearing in
    over 200 instances across the isolates. This is highly significant
    as blaCTX-M-15 is a globally dominant variant of extended-spectrum
    beta-lactamase (ESBL) [3]. Its high frequency suggests widespread
    resistance to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, which are
    critical for treating severe human infections.

-   **blaTEM-1B_1** follows closely as the second most common gene.
    While often conferring narrower resistance (e.g., to ampicillin),
    its high prevalence in the isolates highlights its role as a fundamental building     block of resistance in Gram-negative bacteria like *E. coli*. 
    
-   **blaNDM-5_1** ranks third, which is particularly concerning from a clinical
    perspective. This gene encodes a carbapenemase, providing resistance
    to carbapenems, which are "last-resort" antibiotics [4]. Its presence in
    a high frequency indicates a significant risk of "untreatable"
    infections moving through the One Health chain. 
    
Beyond beta-lactams, the data reveals a core set of resistance genes frequently shared across human,animal, and environmental sectors: 

-   **Efflux and Housekeeping Resistance:** The mdf(A)\_1 gene, a multidrug efflux       pump, is ubiquitous in these isolates. Its role in pumping out various toxic
    compounds makes it a common feature in both clinical and
    environmental bacterial genomes. 
    
-   **Tetracycline and Sulfonamide Resistance:** Genes like tet(A)\_6 and sul2_2         appear with high frequency. These are classic examples of resistance linked to
    long-term antibiotic use in both human medicine and agriculture
    (e.g., in poultry and livestock). Their frequent detection
    underscores the ongoing exchange of genetic material between the
    environment and food-producing animals. 
    
The presence of multiple high-risk genes in the same dataset suggests that many of these 100 isolates are MDR. Since many of these genes are carried on mobile genetic elements like plasmids [3, 4], they can easily jump between different bacterial species and across geographic borders. This interconnectedness emphasizes that a high frequency of blaNDM-5 or blaCTX-M-15 in one sector, directly threatens the efficacy of antibiotics in human clinics globally.

## 3.4 Drug class distribution by isolation source

Figure 4 illustrates a critical disparity in antimicrobial class distribution across One Health sectors, with Beta-lactams emerging as the dominant drug class in both human and chicken isolates. In the isolates retrieved from humans, the count of Beta-lactam resistance exceeds 500, which is significantly higher than all other categories. This trend is also seen in the chicken sector, where Beta-lactams are also the most frequent, though at a lower scale (reaching nearly 110). The high prevalence in these two sectors highlights a significant overlapping resistance profile, likely driven by the widespread clinical and agricultural use of penicillins and cephalosporins.

Beyond Beta-lactams, the sectors exhibit distinct secondary resistance signatures. Human isolates show a substantial burden in the "Other" category (over 200 counts), reflecting a complex multidrug-resistant environment. In contrast, the poultry and chicken sectors demonstrate a more diverse spread across classes like Phenicols, Tetracyclines, and Fluoroquinolones. Notably, the poultry sector shows a high count for Phenicols (near 18), a class often used in veterinary medicine, which appears relatively negligible in the human sector. This distinction highlights sector-specific selective pressures, where agricultural practices introduce unique resistance fingerprints not as commonly seen in human clinical data.

The smaller categories, such as beef and clinical, are dominated by "Unclassified" resistance mechanisms, with beef also showing a presence of Tetracyclines. While the counts in these sectors are lower overall, the "Unclassified" dominance suggests the presence of emerging or less-characterized resistance genes that warrant further investigation.

## 3.5 Geographic Patterns of Antimicrobial Resistance

Figure 5 provides a detailed geographic breakdown of antimicrobial class dominance, revealing distinct regional signatures of resistance across the nine countries. China and Nigeria stand out as the most heavily burdened regions, exhibiting a high count and broad diversity of resistance classes. In Nigeria, Beta-lactams are the most prevalent, closely followed by Fluoroquinolones and Tetracyclines, indicating multi-drug resistance that is likely driven by diverse selective pressures. China shows a similarly high burden across nearly all classes, with Phenicols and Tetracyclines reaching high counts (around 15), reflecting the intense antimicrobial use typical of regions with large-scale industrial agriculture and dense human populations [5].

In contrast, Western nations like the United Kingdom, USA, and Germany display more specialized resistance profiles. The USA and UK show a notable presence of Beta-lactams and Tetracyclines, but at lower absolute counts compared to Nigeria or China, suggesting potentially different stewardship levels or a narrower range of circulating MDR clones. Interestingly, Germany and France show a relatively balanced distribution across Beta-lactams, Fluoroquinolones, and Tetracyclines, while Germany uniquely displays a presence of Polymyxin resistance, a critical "last-resort" antibiotic class. This regional variation highlights how local antibiotic consumption patterns in both clinical and veterinary sectors directly shape the genomic AMR profile of each country.

Regions such as Argentina, Brazil, and New Zealand appear dominated by "Unclassified" resistance mechanisms in this specific isolate set. While their documented counts for specific drug classes are lower, the high proportion of Unclassified and Other categories suggests that these regions may harbor emerging or less-common resistance determinants that are not captured by standard classification panels.

## 3.6 Heatmap of resistance classes by country

Figure 6 provides a comprehensive hierarchical clustering analysis, visualizing the MDR similarities across the nine countries and seven antibiotic classes. The dendrograms and standardized color scale (Z-scores from -2 to 2) reveal two primary clusters of countries based on their resistance fingerprints.

- **Regional Resistance Hotspots:** The upper cluster, comprising Germany, France, Nigeria, and China, exhibits the highest burden across recognized drug classes. Nigeria and China show particularly strong positive correlations (indicated by red-to-orange hues) with Beta-lactams and Other resistance classes. Notably, Germany displays a distinct high-intensity signature for Phenicols, a finding that separates it slightly from the others in its sub-cluster. This grouping suggests that despite geographic distance, these nations share an "intensified" AMR profile, likely driven by high antibiotic selection pressures in both clinical and industrial agricultural sectors.

- **Emerging and Unclassified Resistance:** A second, distinct cluster identifies Argentina, Brazil, and New Zealand as regions dominated by Unclassified resistance mechanisms. The intense red block in the "Unclassified" column for these countries suggests that their bacterial isolates carry a high burden of resistance genes that do not fit into the standard primary drug categories. This is a critical One Health observation; while they may show lower counts for traditional drugs like Fluoroquinolones or Polymyxins (indicated by blue, negative Z-scores), they harbor a significant reservoir of emerging or less-characterized resistance determinants that could represent the next generation of clinical threats.

- **Global Trends and Outliers:** The United Kingdom and USA occupy an intermediate position, showing moderate positive correlations with Beta-lactams and Tetracyclines but generally lower intensity across the board compared to the China-Nigeria-Germany group. Interestingly, Polymyxins (last-resort antibiotics) show a notable negative correlation (deep blue) across most Western nations and China, indicating a currently lower relative burden compared to other classes.

)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3.7 Heatmap of resistance genes by country

Figure 7 provides a high-resolution hierarchical clustering analysis of specific AMR genes across five key countries, revealing how particular molecular determinants drive the regional resistance profiles previously observed. 

- **High-Risk Carbapenemase and Beta-Lactamase Signatures:** The heatmap identifies China and Germany as major hotspots for critical beta-lactamase genes, though their genetic drivers differ significantly. China shows a high positive correlation with blaNDM-5_1, a high-risk carbapenemase gene that confers resistance to "last-resort" carbapenem antibiotics. This finding is particularly concerning as blaNDM-5 is known for its high carbapenemase activity and rapid dissemination via IncX3 plasmids [4]. In contrast, Germany displays a dominant signature for blaTEM-1B_1, a common but foundational resistance gene against penicillins. This disparity suggests that while both nations face high beta-lactam pressure, China's profile is skewed toward newer, more potent carbapenem resistance, whereas Germany's is anchored in widespread, established ESBL mechanisms. 

- **Dominant ESBL and Efflux Drivers in the USA and Nigeria:** A separate cluster identifies USA, Nigeria, and France as being primarily driven by the blaCTX-M-15_1 and mdf(A)_1 genes.Nigeria and France exhibit strong positive correlations with blaCTX-M-15_1, the globally dominant ESBL variant. Its prevalence in these regions highlight a shared risk of treatment failure for common infections, as this gene effectively hydrolyzes third-generation cephalosporins [6]. The USA shows a unique and intense signature for mdf(A)_1, a multi-drug efflux pump. This gene's high intensity in the US suggests that resistance in this region may be heavily supplemented by non-specific efflux mechanisms that can pump out a wide variety of structurally unrelated toxic compounds, including disinfectants and various antibiotic classes. 

The clustering of tet(A)_6 and mph(A)_2 across several regions, particularly showing moderate intensity in China and Nigeria, reflects the ongoing selective pressure from tetracyclines and macrolides—classes heavily used in both human medicine and animal agriculture. The co-occurrence of these "housekeeping" resistance genes with high-risk clinical determinants like blaNDM-5 or blaCTX-M-15 indicates that many of these isolates are likely MDR. From a One Health perspective, this map confirms that regional AMR "personalities" are shaped by a mix of globally successful clones (like those carrying blaCTX-M-15) and locally intensified threats (like blaNDM-5 in China), all of which can easily traverse the human-animal-environment interface.

top_countries <- resfinder_fulldata %>%

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3.8 Temporal Trends of Dominant Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (2018–2022)

Figure 8 presents the temporal dynamics of the five most prevalent AMR genes from 2018 to 2022. Notably, it was observed that blaCTX-M-15_1 exponentially increased, rising from approximately 50 detections in 2018 to over 150 by 2020. As a dominant ESBL, its rapid escalation suggests an intensification of selective pressures or the successful clonal expansion of MDR lineages within the One Health framework during this period.

In contrast, other core resistance genes exhibit more fluctuating or declining trends. blaTEM-1B_1 showed a significant peak in 2020 before sharply declining, while blaNDM-5_1, a critical carbapenemase gene, appears as a high-frequency outlier in 2018 but shows minimal sustained detections in subsequent years. This lack of a continuous line for blaNDM-5_1 may indicate sporadic outbreaks or shifts in the specific isolates sampled annually rather than a stable, long-term establishment across all regions.

mdf(A)_1 and tet(A)_6 maintained relatively low and stable detection levels throughout the study period, both trending downward toward 2022. This stability suggests that while these genes are ubiquitous components of the bacterial "resistome," they were not the primary drivers of the recent surge in resistance. Overall, these temporal patterns emphasize that the global AMR landscape is highly dynamic, characterized by the rapid rise of specific high-threat genes like blaCTX-M-15_1, which increasingly outcompete more established resistance determinants across human, animal, and environmental sectors.

# Conclusion and Recommendations

Findings from this study highlight that AMR is a globalized, interconnected threat where the intensification of resistance in one sector; particularly human, clinical, and poultry production; directly impacts the others. To mitigate this escalating threat, integrated One Health genomic surveillance must be prioritized, focusing on cross-sectoral monitoring of emerging "Unclassified" genes in currently low-burden regions, targeted stewardship in poultry and human clinical sectors to curb the expansion of ESBL and carbapenemase genes, and global collaboration to track the intercontinental movement of high-risk clones like blaCTX-M-15_1.
